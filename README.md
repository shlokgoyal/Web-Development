# Full Stack Web Development Progress Tracker
This repository is a personal journal documenting my journey in learning full stack web development. It contains my projects, experiments, and notes as I work through various technologies and frameworks for both front-end and back-end development. Key areas of focus include:

* Mastering front-end technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
* Building dynamic user interfaces with frameworks like React, Vue, or Angular
* Learning back-end development with Node.js, Express, and database systems (SQL, NoSQL)
* Developing RESTful APIs and handling server-side logic
* Exploring full stack projects that integrate front-end and back-end components
* Implementing user authentication, authorization, and security best practices
* Progress updates, challenges faced, and lessons learned throughout the journey

This repository is for tracking my self-learning process in full stack development. It is not intended as a tutorial, but others are welcome to browse my progress and code as I continue to learn and improve.
